# 🌟 Mapping The Atoms 

## ⚛️ About
A radiant exploration of the world's nuclear power infrastructure! This project maps out nuclear facilities across the globe, helping illuminate the atomic landscape that powers our modern world.

## 🎯 Features
- 📍 Geospatial visualization of nuclear power plants
- 🏭 Detailed reactor information including type, model, and capacity
- ⏳ Historical operational data from construction to decommissioning
- 🌍 Global coverage with data from multiple international sources

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone this repository (it's not radioactive, we promise!)
2. Install dependencies
3. Fire up the application
4. Start exploring the atomic atlas!

## 🛠️ Built With
- Nuclear-grade data from WNA/IAEA
- Cutting-edge mapping technologies
- Absolutely zero nuclear fusion (yet)

## 📊 Data Sources
Our enriched dataset comes from trusted sources including:
- World Nuclear Association (WNA)
- International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
- Various national nuclear regulatory bodies
